Using a 60 ml cookie dough or ice cream scoop, place 6 balls of dough onto each tray, evenly spaced. Bake until the cookies are golden and still slightly soft, about 14 minutes, rotating and swapping the trays halfway through the cooking time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeave the cookies on the trays for 5 minutes, then place on a wire rack until cool.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServe these warm or cool, according to your preference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStore the cookies in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"
