Here, I'm substituting like mad to create what you might call Greek-style nachos.Mine go like this: pita triangles toasted with olive oil; a sauce of feta and yogurt, spiked with mint and lemon; a topping of ground lamb with onion and cumin; and a garnish of tomatoes, cucumbers and olives. The whole thing takes maybe a half-hour, and it\u2019s all familiar except for the arrangement.\n                  \n      Featured in: \n      Behold, The Greek Nacho.\u00a0\n   \n\n\n\n              "
