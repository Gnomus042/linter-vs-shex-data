Socks are missing, teeth need to be brushed and breakfast needs to be on the table in less than ten minutes. That\u2019s when it\u2019s time to harness the deliciousness of bananas and crunchy goodness of pecans and serve up bowls of banana bread oatmeal. Then sit back and watch just how quickly crazy turns into cozy."
