The cauliflower or broccoli needs no attention as it roasts, only the sound of the buzzer to remind you to take it out of the oven.\nTry this with\u00a0Chicken, Broccoli and Sugar Snap Pea Stir Fry,\u00a0Lemon and Scallion Chicken Stir Fry,\u00a0Chicken and Cabbage Stir Fry with Miso Sauce,\u00a0\u00a0Chicken and Spinach Stir-Fry with Ginger and Oyster Sauce or\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spicy Stir Fried Beef and Vegetables.\nIt\u2019s also terrific at room temperature, which makes a side dish ultra-valuable.\n\nWe\u2019re cauliflower lov-ahs in my house.\u00a0 Hence the following:\nSauteed and Braised Cauliflower with Mustard Seeds and Green Peppercorns\nMoroccan Carrot and Cauliflower Soup\nBraised Cauliflower with Anchovies and Capers\n\u00a0\nWe are also drizzle lovers:\nRoasted Cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts and Leeks with Spicy Drizzle\nRoasted Cauliflower and Carrots with Olive Drizzle\n\u00a0\nThat last one sounds a little weird. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tCauliflower with Sesame Drizzle\n\t\t\n\t\tThe hunt for a new and simple side dish is over.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t Print Recipe\n\t\t Pin Recipe\n\t\t Rate Recipe\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nCourse: Side Dish\nServings: 4 People\nCalories: 176.18kcal\nAuthor: Katie Workman\n\n\nIngredients1 large head cauliflower 1 \u00be pound  (or substitute the same amount of broccoli heads)2 tablespoons olive oilKosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste2 tablespoons untoasted sesame seeds optional2 tablespoons soy sauce1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil1 teaspoon honey1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce\nInstructionsPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.   Cut the cauliflower into florets.  Place the cauliflower on a rimmed baking sheet, and drizzle with the olive oil.  Toss well, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast for about 25 minutes, until crisp-tender and browned at the edges. Meanwhile, if you are using the sesame seeds, heat a very large dry skillet over medium heat.  Add the sesame seeds and stir frequently for about 1 or 2 minutes, until they start to become golden. Transfer them to a plate. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, and Sriracha sauce.  When the cauliflower is roasted, transfer it to a serving platter and drizzle over the sauce, or pass it on the size for everyone to drizzle over their portion.  Sprinkle the top with sesame seeds, if desired, and serve hot or warm. \n\n\nNutritionCalories: 176.18kcal | Carbohydrates: 12.76g | Protein: 5.47g | Fat: 13.05g | Saturated Fat: 1.87g | Sodium: 589.36mg | Potassium: 631.16mg | Fiber: 4.51g | Sugar: 5.41g | Vitamin C: 96.4mg | Calcium: 82.66mg | Iron: 1.63mg\n\n   Tried this recipe?Mention @katieworkman100 or tag #dinnersolved!\n\n"
