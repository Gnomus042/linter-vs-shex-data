Put the chicken pieces into a wok or a saucepan, add the all-purpose coconut milk (and water, if using canned coconut milk), the galangal slices, lemongrass, coriander root, lime leaves, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce, stir and bring to the boil. Simmer until the chicken is tender, then add the thick coconut milk. Just before the liquid boils again remove the saucepan from the heat, and add the chillies, lime juice and more fish sauce to taste. Pour the contents into a serving bowl and garnish with coriander. On the table place a small bowl of fish sauce and some lime wedges cut attractively. Diners adjust their own seasonings to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo make a vegetarian version of this dish use sliced pumpkin and/or button or other mushrooms and baby corn in place of chicken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"
