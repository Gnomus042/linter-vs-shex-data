All ingredients go into a medium sized saucepan. Bring to the boil then simmer for 20 minutes or until the sauce has thickened. Give it a stir now and again. Cool and set aside.\nNext, grab a large bowl and add the butter and sugar. Whisk until light and fluffy. Mix in the egg little by little. If the mixture starts to curdle, add a tablespoon of flour. This will bring the batter back together.\nAdd the coffee and vanilla. Gently fold in the sifted flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and pinch of salt. Divide between the two cake tins and bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean.\nCool in the tin for 5 minutes. Then turn out onto a wire rack to finish cooling.\nIt\u2019s butter cream time. Beat the butter with the icing sugar and brown sugar. Add vanilla, beat again. Cover with cling film and set aside.\nNow, to take on the ganache. Melt butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. Take the bowl off the heat and cool for 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and beat until smooth.\nThe finale. Putting it all together. Spread buttercream over the top of one of the cakes. Top with the cherry compote then place the second cake on top. Spread over the chocolate ganache and leave to set for about 1 hour.\nNow, grab a slice.\n\t\t\t"
