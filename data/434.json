Ideal for those warmer evenings or when you have a few people to feed at a party or gathering. If you're vegan or vegetarian then all you need to do is substitute the tuna for more avocado. A fantastic easy-to-follow dish which you can whip up in no time at all!\n-\nBoil the potatoes, drain and cool.\nCube the tuna and mix with the lime juice and zest, soy sauce and sesame oil and leave to marinade for 4 minutes.\nServe with all the remaining ingredients and some coriander, a sprinkle of sesame seeds and more lime wedges.\n\u00a0\nFor the vegan version, omit the tuna and add more avocado\n\n\n                "
