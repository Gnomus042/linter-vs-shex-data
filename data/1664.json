Let the fruit macerate with the sugar and bay at room temperature for at least 2 hours, or overnight. The longer the fruit sits, the more bay flavor. When you return to the bowl, the fruit will be sitting a deep puddle of its own juice. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly as it should be. Pick the bay leaves out of the filling and discard them.

Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F. Bake for 35-45 minutes more, until the crust is deeply golden and the juices bubble slowly at the pie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a convection oven, rotate the pie halfway through to ensure even baking.

The idea is to have more water than you need for the recipe (which will probably use 1\u00e2\u0081\u00842 cup or less) at a very cold temperature, not to actually freeze the water or use all 11\u00e2\u0081\u00842 cups in the dough.\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt. Cut 1\u00e2\u0081\u00842- to 1-tablespoon pieces of butter and drop them into the flour. Toss the fat with the flour to evenly distribute it.\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        Position your hands palms up, fingers loosely curled. Scoop up flour and fat and rub it between your thumb and fingers, letting it fall back into the bowl after rubbing. Do this, reaching into the bottom and around the sides to incorporate all the flour into the fat, until the mixture is slightly yellow, slightly damp. It should be chunky\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly pea-size with some almond- and cherry-size pieces. The smaller bits should resemble coarse cornmeal.\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        Take the water out of the freezer. Pour it in a steady thin stream around the bowl for about 5 seconds. Toss to distribute the moisture. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably need to pour a little more water on and toss again. As you toss and the dough gets close to perfection, it will become a bit shaggy and slightly tacky to the touch. Press a small bit of the mixture together and toss it gently in the air. If it breaks apart when you catch it, add more water, toss to distribute the moisture, and test again. If the dough ball keeps its shape, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done. (When all is said and done, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have added about 1\u00e2\u0081\u00843 to 1\u00e2\u0081\u00842 cup water.)\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        With firm, brief pressure, gather the dough in 2 roughly equal balls (if one is larger, use that for the bottom crust). Quickly form the dough into thick disks using your palms and thumbs. Wrap the disks individually in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for an hour to 3 days before rolling.\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    "
