Add tuna and saute until browned on the outside but still pink inside, about 2 minutes. Remove from the pan, season with salt and pepper and set aside.\n                        Reduce heat to medium and add the remaining 1\u00bd teaspoons oil to the pan. Add onions, carrots, celery and 3 teaspoons of the chopped garlic. Saute until the vegetables are softened, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mash with the back of a spoon or a potato masher. Add broth, wine, thyme, strips of lemon zest and bay leaf; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.\n                        Return the tuna to the sauce, reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the fish is opaque in the center, about 5 minutes more. Discard strips of lemon zest and bay leaf. Taste and adjust seasonings.\n                        Meanwhile, combine parsley, grated lemon zest and the remaining 1 teaspoon chopped garlic in a small bowl; set aside.\n                        Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes or according to package directions. Drain and place on individual plates. Spoon the tuna sauce over the top. Sprinkle with the parsley mixture and serve.\n            "
