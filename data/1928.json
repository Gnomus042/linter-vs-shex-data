Smashing that Lady s Guide pre order button harder than Monty wants to smash Percy WAIT What OoHold a second When did this become a thing and why the freaking hell didn t I know about it I need Monty and Percy in my life I m soo going to savour this Well, as soon as I get my own copy of course PMackenzi you make me very happy XDI hope you know that lol I m ready for the gay This was entirely adorable and so utterly awkward it was hilarious I actually could read an infinitely long series about Percy and Monty, juuuust saying in case the bookish gods want to grant that request It is pretty much 50pgs of Monty and Percy trying to have sex and everything of ever going wrong It made me laugh out loud though I love their banter and Monty s panic meltdowns and the fact that the worst thing in the world that s ever happened to him is getting his hair wet in the ocean.Anyway, aww, this is the cutest and I am so excited for Felicity s book.Because the list of things I am capable of has been thoroughly exhausted in the last month sunbathing and sleeping late and looking handsome while eating grapes You re my reward Shit reward I am Why do you think everyone needs some sort of recompense for being around you he says, his voice so gentle I almost start to cry.MONTY WHO PANICS WHEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT HIS FEELINGS Monty Percy are disastrous idiots and they re so in love and I AM THRIVING The Queer Teen Historical You Didn T Know Was Missing From Your Life Teen Vogue, On The Gentleman S Guide To Vice And VirtueIn This Funny And Frothy Novella That Picks Up Where The New York Times Bestselling The Gentleman S Guide To Vice And Virtue Leaves Off, Freshly Minted Couple Monty And Percy Fumble Through Their First Time TogetherMonty S Epic Grand Tour May Be Over, But Now That He And Percy Are Finally A Couple, He Realizes There Is Something Nerve Wracking Than Being Chased Across Europe Getting Together With The Person You LoveWill The Romantic Allure Of Santorini Make His First Time With Percy Magical, Or Will All The Anticipation And Build Up Completely Spoil The Mood 1 The Gentlemen s Guide To Vice and Virtue The Gentlemen s Guide To Getting Lucky 2 The Lady s Guide To Petticoats and Piracy omfg i love them so much it hurts WE HATE RICHARD PEELE Ugh, this was ridiculously cute and hilarious and I can die happy now My heart is so full and my stomach hurts from laughing If you didn t already know, I fucking adore Monty and Percy I love them and The Gentleman s Guide so much that I m still, after six months and reading it three times, unable to write a review because I don t think I can write down just how much I love everything about these characters and these books and how important I think they are I could seriously pick it up right this moment, like I want to, and delight in it just as much as I did the first time I LURVE it Anyways, the novella Really it s of a short story because it s really very short, 50 pages, but omg it was sooo fucking cute and such a perfect morsel of love, happiness and humor and I m just SO HAPPY ABOUT IT I love the small references that Mackenzi made back to Gent s Guide, it made me feel like I was sharing an inside joke with friends There was a lot of talking going on between Monty and Percy, which I was so happy about because they are extremely bad at talking about their feelings, and I loved seeing them starting to create the foundation for a strong, honest, and communicative relationship Monty and Percy were so sweet and in love, and I couldn t stop swooning and laughing at the situations they were putting themselves in There were multiple times when I whispered aloud oh dear God Monty.This is YA, and although I had a small hope, I knew I wasn t going to get the detailed scenes that I do in my adult MM but that being said This was pretty freaking good, and I just want to applaud Mackenzi for not only bringing such an amazing couple to YA, but also being like Yep, I m going to write a whole novella about them trying to have sex with each other, for teens to read, and it s going to be sweet and full of funny moments and loving words, and there mostly won t be any fade to black because THIS IS OKAY.This review is getting long for a 50 page novella so short answer I FUCKING LOVED THIS Monty, Percy, Felicity and their pirate companions are hilarious and I love hanging out with them I want a million stories about them because I would seriously read about them watching paint dry While we re on the topic of Felicity I will say that I was mostly excited for her book to get glimpses of Monty and Percy, hopefully making out in the background and sticking their hands down each other s trousers, but this made me love her so much than I did in the first book, where she was very much a secondary character, and I m really excited for her book and the shenanigans her and her girl gang get intoYou don t owe me sex You don t owe me anything I m with you because I want to be And if we re together, it ll be because we want to be And we are going to London together because we want to And it s going to be a disaster But that s all right, because we ll have each other We ll be disastrous together \t\t"
