Drizzle 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil, \u00bc teaspoon salt and \u00bc teaspoon black pepper on each chicken breast. Flip over and repeat. Bake for 33 minutes. Remove from the oven. Immediately, cover chicken first with parchment paper and then aluminum foil. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before cutting into small dice.\nPlace diced chicken in a large bowl. Add the remaining ingredients (except of the bread) and mix well. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes or until cold.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to make the sandwiches, use about \u00bd cup of chicken salad on each sandwich. (If your favorite gluten-free bread tends to get soggy easily, lightly toast it before assembling). Slice diagonally and assemble on a platter. \u00a0Enjoy!\n\t\t"
