raised her daughter But Daphne is having trouble cutting the ties of her apron string with her daughter Ellery, who has been spoiled all her life, especially by her father Daphne wants to get on with her life and Ellery thinks she should stay as she is, just her mother But Daphne is not having it She misses something she had been lacking in her marriage Sex and although there other ways of going about this, she finds herself attracted to the contractor who is remodeling the house that she is putting up for sale He just happened to be just a few years older than her daughter Does she go for it You will have to read the book to find out The relationship between a mother and a daughter is like walking through a landmine well in my estimation it is Daphne wants to change her life and Ellery wants her mother to stay the way she was, always being there when ever Ellery needed her Daphne wantsand she s going to get it Both women have secrets and until they can be honest with each other, life is going to be a rough ride and the men in their lives will only complicate their relationship I really loved this book I so admired Daphne for taking charge of her life and with Ellery, there were times I wanted someone to give her a kick up the backside Liz Talley gave us some great characters that added great dimensions to the story I especially loved Daphne s long time friend who spoke her mind on how to live your life on your own terms This story had so many twits and surprises that I could not put it down and I also did not want it to end, but Liz Talley brought this book to a wonder HEA for Daphne and for Ellery Thank you Liz Talley, and Netgalley for giving me the opportunity to read this book I look forward to the next book by and author who has become a must read for me I fell in LOVE with this book I loved the characters This book resonated with me especially the idea of how to live your true authentic life on your own terms and that is exactly what the protagonist Daphne was on a journey to do The story was well developed with a quite a few plot twists which kept me engaged and flipping the pages like a frantic person The characters were well fleshed out and complex.If you haven t read this author, you are very much missing out I really enjoy Liz Talley I fell in LOVE with this book I loved the characters This book resonated with me especially the idea of how to live your true authentic life on your own terms and that is exactly what the protagonist Daphne was on a journey to do The story was well developed with a quite a few plot twists which kept me engaged and flipping the pages like a frantic person The characters were well fleshed out and complex.If you haven t read this author, you are very much missing out I really enjoy Liz Talley s writing style that keeps the readers attention I was so invested in these characters, I was sad to see the book end Liz Talley has a gift for creating flawed, fascinating, and memorable characters, embedded in a narrative that draws you in and doesn t let go The story focuses on a mother, Daphne Witt, and her daughter Ellery Daphne, who was pregnant in high school, and then married to Rex, raised Ellery Daphne found great success as a children s author, which her husband couldn t handle, and the two divorced Ellery is a spoiled, entitled person, who is engaged to Josh, a first year medical student Ellery Liz Talley has a gift for creating flawed, fascinating, and memorable characters, embedded in a narrative that draws you in and doesn t let go The story focuses on a mother, Daphne Witt, and her daughter Ellery Daphne, who was pregnant in high school, and then married to Rex, raised Ellery Daphne found great success as a children s author, which her husband couldn t handle, and the two divorced Ellery is a spoiled, entitled person, who is engaged to Josh, a first year medical student Ellery just finished her degree in fashion design, but did not get the one internship she applied for, and with no backup plan, comes home to Shreveport to live with Josh, and work for her mom Ellery has a lot of growing up to do, which she accomplishes despite a lot of wrong turns and atrocious behavior.The book is about both Daphne and Ellery s journey to happiness and, in Ellery s case, maturity as well Even Rex, the doofus ex husband, comes to a better understanding of his boorish behavior, so there may be some redemption in his future I won t writeabout the story in order for you to enjoy the journey without spoilers.I mentioned above Liz Talley s gift in creating memorable characters As an example, let me use the minor character of Clay Caldwell, a 25 year old contractor, who once briefly dated Ellery when both were in in high school Clay is a contractor who is renovating Daphne s house, and is attracted to Daphne as much as Daphne is attracted to Clay After a few initial few scenes of mutual attraction, Clay makes two short appearances later in the book His character became so real to me I worried how Clay would end up in life That is magical writing I just loved this book, as I followed the unfolding, interweaving stories of Daphne and Ellery.I received an Advanced Reader Copy of this book from the publisher and am voluntarily reviewing the book   Daphne, almost 40 years old, with a strained relationship with her spoiled, beautiful daughter that she her ex husband, Rex, adore, is finally at a point to take action to be happy with herself and her life, after her divorce and rapid accent to be an accomplished children s book author and illustrator That is a lot to put into one sentence, but that is how this book feels to me It hooked me in the first chapter and there was no looking back It never let me go I was absorbed in the liv Daphne, almost 40 years old, with a strained relationship with her spoiled, beautiful daughter that she her ex husband, Rex, adore, is finally at a point to take action to be happy with herself and her life, after her divorce and rapid accent to be an accomplished children s book author and illustrator That is a lot to put into one sentence, but that is how this book feels to me It hooked me in the first chapter and there was no looking back It never let me go I was absorbed in the lives of the characters Daphne became pregnant at 16 and soon married Rex They built a good life with their daughter, Ellery, but it was always Daphne that held them all together She was the fixer of all problems and the worker ant that got everything done After her divorce, she truly found herself and she liked the person she was successful, talented and worthy of love.Ellery always had a golden cloud above her Everything she wanted, she received Almost everything in her life went her way On the odd occasion that she was not the chosen one , her parents stepped in and made it better She is approaching her 23rd birthday and her life is now totally crumbling She has no idea how to handle a life that is not perfect and she is falling apart inside, while smiling on the outside denying all the issues.There is so muchgoing on in this story, but you should experience that first hand and not in a review Liz Talley does an excellent job of character development Each character is unique and memorable I especially love a minor character Tippy Lou She is a spicy, tell it like it is, hippy spiritualist If you do not want your problem discussed honestly, it is best to not visit her.This book is so well written and the story flows so easily I truly enjoyed every moment of my time in this story There are some serious issues tackled and then the humor came and I was laughing out loud and smiling I will also add that I love the book cover I want to thank NetGalley.com and the author, Liz Talley for allowing me to read this fantastic book my review is my own opinion, not influenced by receiving the ARC of this book \t\t"
