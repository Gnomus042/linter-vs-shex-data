Place banana on the center diagonal of tin foil.\n\u00a0\nStuff each banana with approximately 2 tablespoons of marshmallows and 6 raspberries.\n\u00a0\nPull up corners of tin foil to create a tent over the top of banana, leaving a few inches of headroom so marshmallows won\u2019t melt all over the foil.\n\u00a0\nPlace banana packets on heat source, close lid and cook for approximately 10 minutes or until marshmallows are softened.\n\u00a0\nCarefully remove banana packets and open foil. Banana skins may have turned brown; however, this does not affect taste.\n\u00a0\nDrizzle each banana with one single-serve container of Litehouse Chocolate Dip. Eat warm.\n        "
