Line a baking tray with baking paper.\nAdd the rinsed chickpeas (400g tin), rolled oats (140g), overripe banana (1), maple syrup (60-80g), vanilla extract (1 tsp) and baking powder (1 tsp) to the bowl.

Mix Reverse+Speed 3 / 4 seconds, or mix in with your spatula.\n\u00a0Remove the mixture from the bowl. This is quite a sticky mixture, but leaving it to sit for a few minutes will make it easier to work with.\n\u00a0Spoon tablespoonfuls of the mixture onto the baking tray, then press them down slightly with the back of the spoon.\n\u00a0Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool completely.\n\u00a0Once cooled, store in an airtight container for up to five days.\n\u00a0Enjoy!\n\n\n        "
