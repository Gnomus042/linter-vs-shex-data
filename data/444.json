Add the milk to make a mixture. Using clean hands (otherwise the mixture will become sticky), take a strawberry or a piece of avocado and wrap them in the mixture. Coat each ball in desiccated coconut or high-percentage dark chocolate (if you have completed your diet plan). Put the balls in the fridge for at least an hour.
