I want to put another cautionary note that although Adam and Ronan have moments in CDTH This novel is not in anyway focused on their relationship Adam is a large part of Ronan s life but they re now on different paths going different directions in an effort to come to themselves But this is not to say that they aren t still the two soft cinnamon rolls desperately in love with each other Also, for those that are expecting ride or die friendships like the gang in TRC, this is not that either It s darker and dire it focuses on a very different dynamic I fell in love with the slow building in this book because of that reason If anything, Maggie Stiefvater just proved to me that she can write than one trickYou are made of dreams and this world is not for youAnother major contributor to my adoration of this book was Stiefvater s writing To give you an idea, I read the prologue and everything inside me felt at peace but electric at the same time Her writing is lyrical and the effect is somewhat of a trance I could not put this book down I flew through the pages and was consumed with the need toknow what happensIn an effort to try and encapsulate what a gem of a book this was What it was the interconnected lives of a bunch of misfits, some who dream, some who have come from dreams and some who want the world to stop dreaming.What we didn t know we needed in life For Parsifal Bauer to reach peak Parsifalness What we got ronan and declan making a routine list,a room full of murder crabs, a Lynch falling in love, a black market for weird fantasy objects,ronan being soft for adam and adam being adam, the many frustrating exchanges of business cards and, a return to LindenmereWe fool ourselves better than anyone when we re afraidSide Note woke up to Maggie retweeting my graphics and I m not okay Pre Review plans cancelled sweatpants onalex excited af ronan lynch watch me finish this in a whole ass day. Ugly cover, but I bet my life the words inside are stunning.
