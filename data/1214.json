You will need 2 strips for each cone.Starting at the pointed end, wrap\u00a01\u00a0strip around the cone, overlapping the edges slightly. \u00a0Brush the end with the egg wash then firmly press the end of another strip to join and continue wrapping. \u00a0Repeat with the remaining pastry and cones. \u00a0Brush the wrapped pastry cones with the egg wash. Place the cones onto a baking sheet (pastry end-side down).Bake for 15 minutes or until the pastry cones are golden brown. \u00a0Let the pastries cool completely on the baking sheet on a wire rack. \u00a0Carefully remove the pastry cones from the foil cones.Stir the drained ricotta cheese, confectioners' sugar,\u00a02 tablespoons\u00a0chocolate chips, liqueur, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a medium bowl. \u00a0Gently fold in the whipped cream just until combined. \u00a0Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Microwave the remaining chocolate chips in a medium microwavable bowl for 30 seconds on HIGH. \u00a0Stir. \u00a0Repeat until the chocolate is melted and smooth after stirring. \u00a0Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. \u00a0Dip half of each pastry cone lengthwise into the melted chocolate, sprinkle with the pistachios, if desired,\u00a0and place onto the baking sheet. \u00a0Refrigerate for 10 minutes or until the chocolate is set. \u00a0Spoon or pipe the ricotta mixture into the pastry cones. \u00a0Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 8 hours before serving.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTips\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFor a fresh twist, stir 1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest or 1 teaspoon chopped candied orange peel into the ricotta mixture.\nYou can make these ahead of time. \u00a0Make the cones and filling and keep separately for up to 1 day (filling in refrigerator and cones in an airtight container). \u00a0Filled cones can then be refrigerated for up to 8 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"
