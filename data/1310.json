        "@value": " These little cakes make for some fab finger food, or just a light vegetarian lunch. I topped mine with a little baby arugula and pickled radishes to add crunch and color. But they'd also taste great with just a dollop of good homemade aioli. You can substitute regular flour for the rice flour if you aren't eating gluten-free."

When the oil is hot, add the batter in tablespoon-fuls to the pan, making sure not to crowd the cakes. You should be able to fry about 8 at a time, depending on the size of your pan. Press each mound of zucchini down with the back of your spatula to form flat little patties, about 2-inches in diameter. Cook until golden brown on the first side, about 1 to 2 minutes, and then flip and cook until crispy on the second side."
