Focuses on two very different soldiers Ray, an innocent Italian American infantryman and the very different Will, an ambitious officer, speaks Arabic and overestimates his importance in war North Africa, 1942Heavy battle scenes especially where Ray involved I found them repetitive and little boring but that may be that I ve read too many Powerful sense of futility of war and blunders costing too many lives Some very sensitive scenes of camaraderie Empathised with Will s travails.The novel starts in Sicily in 1926 with Angilu, a young shepherd and Ciro Albanese, a mafioso, bound for America, and returns to Sicily with the Allied ..kao da nedostaje jos barem 200 stranica etiri pri e, sudbine, koje se pribli avaju, polako isprepli u..i onda nekako sve nedore eno zavr i teta Gu t je itati. I loved this Set mostly in Sicily in World War II, it follows the lives of several characters, including a Sicilian shepherd, an English soldier, an American Soldier, a Sicilian Princess and a Sicilian emigrant Once the war has started the soldiers find themselves moving gradually towards the Italian island, where they interact with the locals Travel and journeys are central themes, as is self discovery, along with the usual love, life and death I hadn t read anything before  Reading books off our voluminous shelves, rather from library I picked this book up because it takes place during WW II, a subject of interest to me Four men are followed one British soldier, one American Itali I had expected to see a lot of fiction about the First World War in 2014, but it seems like every other new novel I pick up is set in or around the Second World War There s nothing wrong with that, and I ve read enough WW2 fiction to know there are as many stories as there were participants, but still, a novel needs to bring something fresh to the genre to have any impact And on that score, Foulds only half succeeds The parts of the novel devoted to Will, the British Field Security Officer, and his work in Sicily where the Mafia are quietly filling the power vacuum is fascinating and to me at least a fresh perspective The quotes from Wind in the Willows that Foulds works in are well judged and work beautifully, and even when Foulds introduces a scene that you think you ve read many times before the ubiquitous visit to a prostitute he manages to breathe new life into it Unfortunately, the focus of the novel is divided between Will and Ray, an Italian American soldier with dreams of becoming a Hollywood director, and this character is definitely the novel s weak link Ray is almost a clich , a character we ve seen countless times before, and who never truly comes to life Another problem for me were the 100 pages or so set in North Africa where Foulds evokes the Sicilian towns and countryside so well, his North Africa could be a En La Boca Del Lobo Es Una Novela Sobre La Guerra Y La Mafia, La Inocencia Y La Corrupci N, Y La Historia Como Acumulaci N De Lo Irremediable Ambientada Principalmente En Sicilia Durante La Segunda Guerra Mundial, Relata El Intento De Reconstrucci N De Un Pa S Despu S De Una Violenta Contienda A Trav S De La Mirada De Varios Personajes Will Walker, Oficial Ingl S De Seguridad Sobre El Terreno, Lleva A Cabo Una Tentativa De Dominio Del Gran Juego De La Inteligencia Y La Intervenci N Militares Ray Marfione, Soldado De Infanter A Italoamericano, Experimenta El Devastador Trauma Psicol Gico De La Batalla Hasta Que Poco A Poco, Desde Su Escondite Y Con La Ayuda De Una Princesa Siciliana, Emprende El Largo Camino De Retorno A La Vida Cir Albanese Es Un Mafioso Que Ha Disfrutado De Un Prolongado Y Fruct Fero Exilio En Nueva York Durante Los A Os Del Fascismo Italiano Regresa Para Recuperar Su Vida Anterior, Incluida La Esposa Que Desde Hace Mucho Lo Da Por Muerto Junto A Algunos Amigos Liberados De Prisi N Y Con La Ayuda Inconsciente De Los Aliados, Trabaja Por El Restablecimiento Del Control De La Mafia En Sicilia Escrita En Cap Tulos Cortos De Una Intensidad L Rica Extraordinaria, En La Boca Del Lobo Confronta Los Peque Os Detalles Brillantes De La Experiencia Individual Con Unas Fuerzas Hist Ricas De Contundente Enormidad Es Testigo De Los Esfuerzos De Los Personajes Por Encontrar Alg N Significado En Todo Ello, Por Contarse A S Mismos Historias Que Tengan Sentido Los Numerosos Relatos Se Entrelazan Y Se Separan A Lo Largo De Una Novela Que Registra, Con Toda La Brutalidad Posible, Los Acontecimientos De Dichas Vidas Sin Juzgar Su Significado O Su Valor.\t\t"
