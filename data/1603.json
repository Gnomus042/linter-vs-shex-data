        "@value": "Quinoa is a wonderful base for a side dish because you can customize it with an array of different ingredients. These can be sweet, like fruit and honey, or savory, like roasted vegetables and flavorful cheeses. Not only does this grain make a wonderful side dish, but is also ideal for breakfast and a tasty snack.  \nThis quinoa salad came to be when I had a lone red bell pepper in my refrigerator. I decided to roast it and incorporate it in a grain salad. Make sure the pepper gets a bit charred during the preparation process because the char is what gives this salad its distinct taste."
