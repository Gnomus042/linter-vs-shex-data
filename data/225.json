This version uses pork rinds instead of bread crumbs, making it a keto-friendly, paleo-friendly, and a gluten-free treat. Thanks to the air fryer, you won't need a quart of oil to fry them in... just 12 minutes in the air fryer using a quick spray of cooking spray. Serve these treats to your favorite people, they are delightful!\n          "
