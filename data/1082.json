An Engagement Is Supposed To Be A Fun, Exciting Time In A Girl S Life But Things Are Never That Easy For Slash And Me Instead, Someone Is Threatening To Expose Slash S Past A Past So Secret, Even I Know Very Little About It.Before I Can Get Used To The Weight Of Nonna S Antique Ring On My Finger, He S On His Way To Rome And We Re Farther Apart Than We Ve Ever Been Still, I Have No Intention Of Sitting At Home And Letting Him Take On The Vatican By Himself.With A Little Expert Level Hacking, I Learn Slash Is Keeping Secrets From Me Big Ones Dangerous Ones In Fact, The I Dig Into Slash S Past, The I Discover Things About Him I Never Knew Things That Eventually Pit Us Against Each Other.From Rome To The Amalfi Coast To The Highest Levels Of The Vatican, We Both Race To Discover The Truth No Matter What I Find, We Re Officially A Team Now, So I Won T Let Him Face This Alone Even If I Don T Know If Our Relationship Can Survive It.And Don T Miss The Rest Of Julie Moffett S Lexi Carmichael Mysteries No One Lives Twice, No One To Trust, No Money Down, No Place Like Rome, No Biz Like Showbiz, No Test For The Wicked, No Woman Left Behind, No Room For Error, No Strings Attached, No Living Soul And No Regrets, Available Now From Carina Press This Book Is Approximately 100,000 Words No Stone Unturned by Julie Moffett is number eleven in the Lexi Carmichael series and the best one yet I think I have said that about every book in the series but this one finally let us fans get to know Slash and his past.I was thrilled that this time Ms Moffett wrote Slash s thoughts throughout this adventure I have always appreciated his caring, concern and admiration of Lexie, his spy operative skills and his super hacking skills but to finally read his thoughts and feelings made me appreciate him so much Throughout the series Slash s past has been carefully edited for everyone, including Lexie, but in this one we all learn about his work at the Vatican and his childhood All of which made this book an engrossing read for me Lexie, as usual, was her lovable, geeky and awkward self which made me smile I laughed out loud at her white knuckle ride with Slash along the Amalfi coast This time they face a truly Machiavellian plot from Italy that hints of Slash s dark past This book has a plot that speeds along at breakneck speed, wonderful secondary characters that I enjoyed visiting with again and a reveal that was so satisfying that I cheered Ms Moffett also left us with just a small hint of what we may be seeing in the next book at least I hope so I cannot recommend this book highly enough for all readers who enjoy a great mystery with a touch of romance, friendship and family.I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book All of the above opinions are my own. We all have a past The question is, are you going to remain a prisoner to yoursSelf proclaimed geek and expert hacker, Lexi Carmichael feels out of her element when it comes to peopling Never being one to know what to say and do, she finds herself lost at her own engagement party Slash, her fianc e and fellow hacker, is offering the back up needed to fend off her anxiety But when secrets from Slash s past start to threaten Lexi, Slash does the unthinkable by leaving her behind and heading to Rome to face the threat head on and alone Lexi can t believe Slash still does not see them as a team Not one to be left cooling her heals, Lexi instigates an investigation on her own, and what she uncovers has her hopping the first flight to Rome to track down Slash and offer assistance whether he wants it or not As the clues of Slash s birth and past secret agent activities start piecing together, Lexi and Slash find themselves in the crosshairs of a powerful enemy one that is deeply connected within the Vatican and a past Slash can no longer hide No Stone Unturned is the 11th installment to the Lexi Carmichael mystery series, but the first read for me Usually when picking up in the middle of a series, I ve found myself so lost in all the characters and back story that it was hard to enjoy the current plot Not the case here Julie Moffett did an excellent job in the telling of Lexi and Slash s story without bogging down or confusing the mystery in this book No Stone Unturned grabbed and kept my attention from beginning to end Loved and highly recommend Received ARC via NetGalley for honest review Fav quotesI want you to know something I m deeply and intentionally in love with you You can rest assured I m not going to let anything touch what we have You our life it means everything to me Home was where your heart belonged, where the people you loved anchored you Home was where you could be your true self with people who loved you just as you were You re the beginning of my everything  Already on my second read and loving it just as much as the first Although I had read an ARC from NetGalley, the Lexi Carmichael Mysteries series is a must pre order for me I am in awe of every book in this series and No Stone Unturned is my newest favorite Julie Moffett proves time and again that light reading can still reflect quality writing The intricacy of the plots she creates and the evolution of the relationships among her characters are at least a well written those in any genre and the whole point is to provide entertainment Ms Moffett is by far not the only outstanding author among those who strive to entertain us but she is one of my favorites Fans of the series don t need to be sold on each new book In No Stone Unturned, we get a peek at Slash s background which has been a dream for most of us since we first met him Watching Lexi in action, both in her new strong sense of self and the old Lexi under the black cloud persona, is a delight that offers fans the perfect read I doubt that this is the perfect entry book for those new to the series, but I do believe that any reader would love it As you can imagine, I was thrilled to be approved for an ARC from NetGalley and am than ready to shout to all about how much I loved No Stone Unturned It is going to be a regular reread for sure Needless to say, I can hardly wait for the next book NoStoneUnTurned NetGalley Whoa This book had a slightly darker feel than some of the others Maybe it s just me I don t know While the earlier books had high stakes and the potential for massive even global destruction, this one felt personal to Lexi And Slash I mean, they ve finally decided to make their intertwined lives official and suddenly this THING is popping up that threatens to derail them.The issues aren t necessarily on a global scale, but it felt like there was impact to them.Huh Apparently, it s the little things that get me Like Lexi choosing to step back and bide her time once she realized how badly Slash didn t want her to see the thing she was trying to see And their relationship Oh, I like these two together I m big enough to admit I wasn t thrilled with their pairing when it first happened for reasons that had nothing to do with Slash, mind you , but I am ONE HUNDRED PERCENT Team Slash and Lexi now ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.Maybe it was getting into Slash s head that did it I like that guy He s honorable and deadly and REALLY FREAKING GOOD at everything he sets his mind to do He and Lexi make a solid team with skill sets that complement one another in the best possible way.I fell like I m being a little flaily and gushy, but THESE TWO I like how they work things out when things get dicey I like how they stand up and fight for one another when needed I like how they re willing to take on the most powerful people in the world if it comes down to it.Team Slash and Lexi YES Kelly Reading the Paranormal A Lexi Carmichael Mystery 11Our favorite Geek, Lexi Carmichael is back along with her new fianc e, Slash, who has put a huge rock on her finger Yes, she is engaged And before you can say Congratulations, Slash is gone and Lexi is frustrated.Feeling left out and worried she takes her hacking skills to the next level and finds out she may not know Slash and his past at all She has questions And she will stand by her man and fight the people threatening their lives with all she has Typical Lexi.From The Vatican, to the beautiful Amalfi Coast and back again, this fast paced novel has everything a good thriller should have Conspiracy theories, the Catholic Church, a rogue and power hungry priest who will let nothing stand in his way of becoming the next Pope Only the current one has his own plans and his own secret weapon in Slash.This was a non stop action mystery thriller Every other chapter I was saying, What which is a good thing These two may be my favorite book couple.Well Done Netgalley January 14th 2019 by Carina Press This time we get to read from both Lexi and Slash s points of view, as they travel throughout Italy to uncover the reason they were sent mysterious letters During their travels, as they speak to a lot of different people, we learn a lot about Slash s past, and Slash also learns some truths himself Lexi seems to have matured a fair bit, and she really is a stabilising force for Slash in this one This book was a great read No Stone Unturned was a wonderful read, I couldn t rush through I had anticipated conflict between Lexi and Slash I was pleasantly surprised when it delivered instead, heart and a sweet sense of what true commitment to one s partner is all about This book is now tied as my favorite in the series I savored every page. A good book diving into Slash s past, along with some of Lexi s trademark antics Definitely excited to see who and what turn up in the next book.\t\t"
