        "@value": "\n                Wholesome and nutty in flavor, barley makes a superb alternative to arborio rice when making risotto, since it\u2019s a grain that\u2019s naturally plump and chewy when cooked. Make sure to use pearl barley, not hulled barley, since it cooks much faster and is more tender. The best thing about this risotto is that it\u2019s baked, taking away the pressure of constant stirring at the stove. The grated Parmesan and butter stirred in at the end release the barley\u2019s starches, creating a silky, creamy texture. White button, cremini and earthy shiitakes make a tasty, accessible combination, but any combination of oyster, king trumpet and maitake mushrooms would raise the bar. This risotto is a satisfying vegetarian weeknight dinner, but could also accompany any large roast or baked fish.\n                \n\n\n              "
