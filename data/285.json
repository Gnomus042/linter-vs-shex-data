Blitz Speed 9 / 10 seconds. Scrape down sides and use your spatula to wipe around the base of the jug in case any honey hasn't been blended.\nBlend again Speed 9 / 10 seconds. Pour into a jar and place into the fridge.\n\nSalad:\n\nFill the bowl with water (1.2L) and place the rice (300g) into the internal steaming basket. Rinse well under running water, then set the basket in place. Program 35 minutes / Steaming Temperature / Speed 3, measuring cap on.\nOnce cooked, allow to cool completely.\nPlace the diced avocados (2) into a large serving bowl and cover with lime juice (20g). Stir well. This will keep them from going brown.\nAdd the diced red onion (1/2), quartered cherry tomatoes (200g), drained corn (125g tin), rinsed beans (400g tin), sliced spring onions (4) and chopped coriander (1/2 bunch) to a large serving bowl.\nFluff the brown rice with a fork and add it to the serving bowl. Mix to combine.\nCover with dressing and mix to combine well.\nServe or refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavours to develop.\nEnjoy!\n\nNote: You might like to add beef or chicken fajita strips to this salad.\n\n        "
