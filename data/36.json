For even thicker chili feel free to take more of the chili from the dutch oven, puree it in the food processor and add it back.  About ten minutes before it's time to eat add the shredded cooked chicken.  (If you add the chicken too soon it will get overcooked and tough).  Once off heat finish with fresh cilantro, lime juice and scallions if desired.  Enjoy!!"
