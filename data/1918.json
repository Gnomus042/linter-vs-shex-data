Mix together with a wooden spoon until combined, then bring together with your hands. Knead by hand on the work surface for 8-10 minutes, only dusting with a little flour if it's sticky. \n2. Once the dough is smooth and shiny, turn it in your hands, tucking under to make a smooth dome on top. Place seam-side down on a floured baking tray; gently pat down the top to flatten slightly. Cover with a sheet of lightly oiled cling film and leave to rise for 1 hour 15 minutes. \n3. Preheat the oven to 200\u02daC, gas mark 6. Uncover the dough and, using a sharp serrated knife, make three 0.5cm-deep slits across the top. Cover again and leave for 15 minutes. \n4. Uncover, dust the top with a little more flour and bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool completely before slicing and serving with butter.\u00a0\n\n        "
