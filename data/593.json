Meanwhile, rinse and drain the spinach, then transfer to a large, high-sided pan and set over a high heat. Cook, turning now and again, until just starting to wilt. Scrape into a sieve and press out as much liquid as possible. \n2. Reduce the heat under the spinach pan and add the butter. When sizzling, return the wilted spinach to the pan. Stir to coat in the butter and cook for 1-2 minutes. Season and transfer to a plate. Toast the sourdough and rub the (peeled) garlic clove over each slice, almost grating it into the crispy surface of the toast. \n3. Spoon the oil and tomato juices from the roasting tin over the toast, then put the spinach and tomatoes on top. Tear the mozzarella into large chunks and nestle beside the spinach. Season and drizzle over a little more oil. Scatter over the olives and parsley before serving immediately.\n\n        "
