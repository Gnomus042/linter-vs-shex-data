Start adding flour a little ata time until all is in. The batter will be pretty stiff while adding thelast 2 cups!  (Using the hands is ok)  Add chips and nuts now. Dropspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet. Leave room for the cookie to spreadout.  These get big.  Bake 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees. Enjoy! \n                    \n                \n            "
