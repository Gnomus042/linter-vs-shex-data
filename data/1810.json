It\u2019s sort of an apple crumble / apple cake hybrid, consisting of a layer of cake at the bottom, then a layer of spiced apples, and finished off with a crumbly streusel-like topping. The simplicity of this recipe becomes apparent when you realise that the recipe for the cakey bottom layer is actually identical to the crumble topping \u2013 how it works, I have no idea, but somehow it transforms into two different things as it cooks. Must be some sort of magic.\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
