        "@value": "Farro is a hearty whole grain that may well become a staple in your kitchen, appearing in everything from soups to casseroles to warm sides to room temperature salads. \u00a0It\u2019s been around for a long time, once a mainstay of the ancient Roman diet.\nFarro has a substantial chewy texture, and it\u2019s high in fiber and a good source of iron and protein, which also makes it a great anchor for a lot of vegetarian dishes. \u00a0Try using it in recipes that you might ordinarily reach for barley or brown rice.\u00a0 And think about making a batch of this at the beginning of the week, and keeping it in a container in the fridge to dig into all week long.\u00a0 Use them cold, or room temp, or heat up and toss with things like roughly chopped roasted vegetables.\u00a0 (This idea works for whatever grain or grains you are pulling towards on any given moment).\n\nI love using lots of fresh herbs and other leafy greens in whole grain salads, which balance out the heft of the grains and also provide a lovely pop of color and freshness. And I make these kinds of salads continuously during the warmer months, since they keep well, travel well, and having a whole grain salad in the fridge means you never have to wonder what to make for lunch on those days when you\u2019re feeling unimaginative.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be shy with the salt and pepper \u2013 the seasonings really lift the flavor.\nFinally, raw asparagus may seem surprising, but if the asparagus is very fresh it adds a wonderful delicate asparagus flavor, and a nice crunch. \u00a0If the outer peel is thick, which more often is the case with thicker asparagus, then definitely peel the bottom half of the stalks before thinly slicing them, or the texture will be too tough.\n\n\n"
