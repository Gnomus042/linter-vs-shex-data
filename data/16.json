In a small saucepan, bring the half-and-half, the remaining sugar, vanilla bean and the salt to a simmer.\nRemove the pot from the heat and while whisking vigorously, temper the yolk mixture with some of the warm half-and-half. Add the tempered egg mixture to the pot, return it to the heat and heat to 180\u00b0 while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Serve immediately or cool in an ice bath and store covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days.\nTo make the individual clafoutis, process the first 8 ingredients with a mixer until thoroughly combined. Strain the mixture and allow it to rest, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Meanwhile, butter 6, 1-inch-deep gratin dishes and heat the oven to 375\u00b0.\nDistribute the berries evenly in the prepared dishes and add the batter. Place the dishes on a cookie sheet and transfer to the oven. Allow the clafoutis to bake until golden brown and set\u2014about 20 minutes. Remove the clafoutis from the oven, split the surface with a spoon and sauce generously with the warmed cr\u00e8me anglaise. Serve immediately.\t\t"
