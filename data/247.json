Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only just an out of this world coconut cream brownie ice cream recipe. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right\u00e2\u0080\u0094brownies and ice cream in one, so you can understand my excitement with this recipe. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those recipes you never knew you were missing out on, but once you try it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be there to stay. This is actually a dessert that you can freely enjoy on the paleo diet because it only uses all-natural ingredients. Cacao powder and dark chocolate chips bring the chocolatey goodness, while the coconut cream and honey provide a perfectly sweet ice cream texture when frozen. And to top it all off? The recipe even adds in some hazelnuts for good measure."
