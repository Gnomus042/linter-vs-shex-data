It\u2019s moist and lightly sweetened with a hint of spiciness from the cinnamon and cloves. Add chocolate chips for extra decadence, or fill muffin cups and dollop with a cream cheese filling for a breakfast fit for any pumpkin lovers in the house!"

With a hand mixer, beat ingredients together starting at low speed, then move to high speed setting, for 2-3 minutes, or until light and fluffy.\nBeat in vanilla, then add the eggs, 1 at a time until a smooth batter forms.\nAdd dry ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms.\nBeat in pumpkin and vinegar until thoroughly incorporated.\nStir in chocolate chips or chocolate chunks, reserving two tablespoons for sprinkling.\nTo prevent batter from overflowing, remove two muffin\u2019s worth of it and bake separately. I like to pour extra batter into two silicone muffin cups. If you are not using chocolate chips, you can bake all the batter in the two pans.\nPour batter into loaf pans, smooth it out, then sprinkle the loaves with chocolate.\nSet loaves and muffin cups on a cookie sheet and slide into oven. Bake for 40 minutes, checking for browning at the 40 minute mark. Tent loaves with tin foil if they are browning too much, and bake for 10 more minutes.\nRemove pans to a wire rack and cool loaves for one hour. To cleanly remove loaf from pan, cut around edges before inverting on to a plate.\n"
