Until an hour ago, I hadn t realized what a state of undead I d fallen into Sure, I fought daily to kill real Zombies but somewhere along the way I d become one myselfEver since the first episode of LOVE AND DECAY, I have always wondered what Hendrix s thoughts of Reagan was To me he came off cold and insensitive when I read that scene of them actually meeting for the very first time But now I understand that wasn t it at all From the moment he lays eyes on how is it possible that Rachel can write her characters so clearly this pov was excellent Loved and Decay Season 1, Episode 1 from Hendrix s POV A little repetitive as we don t learn too much new information but enjoyable nonetheless. I loved the retelling of the very first episode from Hendrix s perspective We get to see everything that he is thinking All the pressure and responsibility he feels for his family All his worries for Reagan though they just met I honestly loved it so much I m sure many of you are wondering if it is boring since it s the same story from Season 1 Episode 1 Well it isn t boring It is wonderful I loved it and I look forward to when we see another Hendrix POV in the future because I have no d I loved the retelling of the very first episode from Hendrix s perspective We get to see everything This is one of my favorite Apocalypse series Incredible writing and story line I am just eating this series up and so fast, darn This is a story that is of Hendrix Parker s point of view I read it twice And I read th Have to read this zombie series it s epic I ignored the call of Spain s sea and sand to read this brilliant series Kindle one click made me read the entire series while on holidays in Spain An epic adventure filled with lust,love, blood, kisses, zombies, action, suspense, intrigue, fear and resili Mmmmmm.Hendrix It was really interesting to see inside his head, b c he s so stoic and strange that I was wondering what all he was thinking And it didn t disappoint Loved how instantly intrigued he was by Reagan And how confused that made him Yup, a delicious bonus to a great series. 3 Stars. What a nice change to see the other side of the story It s funny how Hendrix became so absorbed in Reagan from the very beginning. Seriously Hendrix Is there any guy hotter than you I don t effing think so OMG leave Reagan and come home with me "
