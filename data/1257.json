        "@value": "(From Lucinda Hutson\u2019s book Tequila! Cooking with the Spirit of Mexico)\nThroughout Jalisco, this refreshing drink is served in large, wide-mouthed clay bowls, called cazuelas, so that the citrus wedges in it may be picked up and eaten or squeezed into the drink. Mexicans pop chunks of watermelon and fresh pineapple into their mouths and sip the tequila-laced libation through a straw. I present this punch in a large glass jar, which shows off the colorful fruits, and serve it in long-stemmed jumbo margarita glasses filled with cracked ice. A guest once called this drink \u201cthe quintessential finger bowl;\u201d I call it the ultimate fruit cocktail. Make sure that guests get plenty of the spiked watermelon and pineapple!"
