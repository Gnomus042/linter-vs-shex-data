Brown sugar lends a light caramel flavour which pairs so well with the peanut butter and sea salt. They're completely flourless, in addition to being vegan and gluten-free, but no one will be the wiser. You must try these in my Obsession-Worthy Peanut Butter Cookie Ice Cream for a decadent summer treat! This recipe is from Oh She Glows Every Day (page 213). \n"
