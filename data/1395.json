        "@value": "When I was\u00a0pregnant with my 1st child, Austin, I instantly craved chilli. Literally the night my husband and I found out we were pregnant, I made my first batch. I found this odd, since I rarely ate chilli and had never made it before. In hindsight, I believe it was my body\u2019s way of telling me I needed more iron and folic acid. Almost two years and dozens of modifications later, I think I have mastered the art of chilli. It has become a weekly staple in our house and my husband\u2019s favourite dish. I not only enjoy the act of cooking chilli, there is just something about stirring a big pot of savoury goodness on the stove that soothes the soul, but I love that one bowl is equivalent to a balanced meal, loaded with dozens of vitamins and minerals and it means leftovers for tomorrow\u2019s lunch and dinner!\n \n"
