Dredge the cakes in additional panko crumbs until completely covered. Arrange the cakes on a sheet pan and chill until ready to cook.   Heat a few glugs of canola or safflower oil in a large aluminum or cast iron skillet over medium-high to high heat. Cook crab cakes (in two batches if necessary, adding more oil as needed) until crispy and light golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Keep the crab cakes hot in a warm oven, if desired. Serve with a lightly dressed arugula salad, a couple of lemon wedges, and a dollop of r\u00e9moulade.    For the r\u00e9moulade, combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl and chill for at least 4 hours. Adjust seasonings to suit personal taste, if desired. \n                "
