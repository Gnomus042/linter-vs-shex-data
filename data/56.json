It the sheer variety of the cuisine that makes it exciting including the spices used, techniques of cooking as well as ingredients used based on diet, weather as well as what is grown locally. When it comes to vegetarian Indian cooking there is an abundance of recipes that are easily adaptable for day to day meals. The key is to include variety of lentils, pulses as well as fresh vegetables. From breads to curries, chutneys, snacks and pickles there is so much to choose from!\nThis vegetarian recipe hailing from the east of India has influences from the state of Orissa (Odisha). The use of five spice mix is a winning ingredient that lifts the overall flavour of the dish. I have added almond paste which thickens the gravy and gives it a creamy consistency. You could opt of cashewnut paste as well if you prefer.\n\t\t\t"
